# 1. Introduction

This Incident Response Procedure outlines the actions and responsibilities that need to be taken when an information security incident occurs within [Flo Apps Ltd](https://floapps.com). An "incident" refers to any event that poses a threat to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the company's data, systems, or networks.

# 2. Objectives

* To detect, assess, and respond to security incidents promptly.
* To minimize the impact of the incident on business operations.
* To restore normal operations as quickly as possible.
* To document incidents for legal, compliance, and post-incident analysis.
* To improve overall security posture by learning from incidents.

# 3. Scope

This procedure applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers involved with the company's IT infrastructure, systems, and data. It covers incidents such as unauthorized access, data breaches, malware infections, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

# 4. Incident Response Team (IRT)

The Incident Response Team is responsible for handling security incidents. The team should be composed of individuals from key areas such as:

* Incident Response Manager (IRM): Oversees the entire incident response process.
* IT Security Lead (SecOps): Manages technical aspects of the incident response.
* Network Administrator: Handles network-related incidents and issues.
* Forensics Analyst: Investigates and collects evidence related to the incident.
* Legal & Compliance Officer: Ensures legal and regulatory requirements are met.
* Communications Lead: Manages internal and external communications during the incident.

# 5. Incident Detection & Identification

Incident Detection Methods:

* Automated alerts from Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools.
* Reports from employees, users, or third-party vendors.
* External threat intelligence feeds.
* Routine monitoring of systems and networks for unusual activity.

Initial Actions Upon Detection:

* Acknowledge the alert: The IT support team or monitoring service acknowledges and evaluates the alert.
* Assess the severity: Categorize the incident based on impact, such as low, medium, or high severity.
* Notify the Incident Response Manager: The IRM must be immediately notified for escalation.

# 6. Incident Classification & Prioritization

Classify the incident based on the type of threat and the severity:

* Low Severity: Minor security events, such as isolated phishing attempts or unauthorized access attempts without data breach.
* Medium Severity: Malware infections affecting a limited number of systems or successful social engineering attacks.
* High Severity: Major breaches, such as ransomware attacks, data exfiltration, or network outages affecting business-critical systems.

Prioritize Response:

* High-priority incidents need immediate attention and action.
* Medium-priority incidents should be handled in parallel with high-priority issues but with less urgency.
* Low-priority incidents are addressed when time permits, without affecting ongoing high- or medium-priority cases.

# 7. Incident Containment

Immediate Action: The goal is to limit the spread of the incident and prevent further damage.

Short-term:

* Isolate affected systems from the network (e.g., disconnect compromised devices).
* Block malicious IP addresses or domains.
* Disable compromised accounts or passwords.

Long-term:

Apply additional security controls, such as firewall rules or enhanced monitoring, to prevent escalation or recurrence.

# 8. Incident Eradication

After containing the incident, the IT team should:

* Identify the root cause of the incident (e.g., compromised credentials, vulnerability exploitation).
* Remove all malicious code (e.g., viruses, worms, ransomware) from infected systems.
* Patch and update affected systems to close vulnerabilities.
* Reset passwords and re-enable accounts after ensuring they are secure.

# 9. Recovery

After eliminating the threat:

* Restore systems and data: Use backups to restore affected systems to a known good state.
* Monitor systems for abnormal activity during recovery.
* Test systems for stability and ensure normal operations are resumed.
* Verify full functionality: Confirm that business-critical systems are operational and the threat has been fully removed.

# 10. Post-Incident Analysis

After the incident is resolved, perform a detailed analysis:

* Incident Documentation: Record all steps taken during the incident, including timelines, actions, and decisions.
* Root Cause Analysis: Determine how the incident occurred and if any gaps or weaknesses in the security posture contributed to the breach.
* Impact Assessment: Assess the financial, operational, and reputational impact of the incident on the company.
* Lessons Learned: Identify opportunities for improvement and make necessary changes to policies, procedures, and defenses.

# 11. Reporting & Communication

Internal Reporting:

* Notify management of the incident, its impact, and the steps taken to address it.
* Provide updates on recovery progress and future prevention measures.

External Communication:

* Clients: Notify impacted clients if their data or services were affected.
* Regulatory Authorities: notify regulatory authorities of the breach within the required timeframes.
* Public Communication: In case of high-impact incidents, work with legal and communications teams to prepare a public statement.

# 12. Legal & Compliance Considerations

* Ensure all actions comply with industry regulations, laws, and standards (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS).
* Maintain evidence for potential litigation or investigation purposes.
* Engage with external legal advisors, if necessary, to understand the regulatory requirements and obligations.

# 13. Post-Incident Remediation

After the incident, implement measures to prevent recurrence:

* Update Policies and Procedures: Revise internal security policies based on lessons learned from the incident.
* Training and Awareness: Conduct security awareness training for employees to prevent social engineering and other common attack vectors.
* Improve Security Controls: Enhance firewall rules, IDS/IPS configurations, and endpoint security tools based on the incident's findings.
* Conduct Regular Audits: Schedule regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.

# 14. Documentation & Continuous Improvement

* Incident Report: A detailed report should be generated documenting all actions, lessons learned, and recommendations for improving future responses.
* Review and Update: Regularly review the incident response procedure to ensure it stays current with evolving threats and compliance requirements.

# 15. Conclusion

The success of an incident response procedure hinges on clear roles and responsibilities, quick detection, effective containment, and continuous improvement. Regular training, testing, and evaluation of the procedure will ensure the company is always prepared for a potential incident.
